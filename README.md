E
=

A graphical interface system for Erlang/OTP inspired by certain concepts of the  X Window System, like a display server written JavaScript (xserver.js) which runs in modern browsers.   This implementation of E utilizes WebSockets to send and receive messages between the Erlang programs (E Clients) and the browser display(s) (E Server).
